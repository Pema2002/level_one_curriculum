DHH, the creator of [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org "Ruby on Rails"), talks about what gave him the motivation to learn to code. David didn’t learn Ruby (and invent Rails) because he was trying to get a job as a programmer. He learned because he was burning to solve a problem, and he needed software to solve it. He learned how to code in Ruby because he needed to solve the problem his company, [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com "Basecamp"), faced with managing their client’s projects.

But finding a meaningful problem to solve isn't easy. Ideas don't just drop out of the sky. By developing your ability to notice and observe the world around you, it’s possible to get skilled at coming up with good ideas.

You face problems every day. Big and small. Most of us are too busy with the rest of our lives to stop and think about these problems. We accept them for what they are and work through or around them. But these problems are the seeds for the best ideas.

Think about something that pisses you off in your life, and consider what you can do to change it into something that makes you happy.

This is how most great ideas are born. The most sustainable ideas stem from problems shared by many others. And if you build a solution for it, there might be people willing to pay you to share it with them.

Discover what that intolerable problem is for you, and it will give you the conviction needed to move forward.

If it’s hard for you to work on something for yourself, it’s also effective to solve a problem for someone you have empathy for. But, if you aren’t experiencing the pain yourself, it’s harder to connect to the issue and design a proper solution.

Thankfully, it’s doable with help.

Think of someone you care about. It could be a relative, a friend, or someone who was born with a profound lack of freedom or choice in their lives. These are the types of people that the best of us live to do work for:

“One weekend my in-laws were visiting, and my wife wanted to make restaurant reservations. She ended up spending three and a half hours calling restaurant after restaurant. I thought it would be great to build a website that could hook up to back-end restaurant reservation terminals.”- Chuck Templeton, Founder of [OpenTable](https://www.opentable.com "OpenTable")

To get in the mindset of looking at problems in the world around us as opportunities to build great solutions, let's take a look at some of the most common solutions we all use and pay for on a regular basis.
