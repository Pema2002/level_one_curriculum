# Marshmallow Challenge Activity

### Required Materials
  * Spaghetti
  * Marshmallows (standard size)
  * Masking tape
  * Measuring tape

### Pre-Activity Setup
  Each student group will need a marshmallow challenge kit.  Each kit should contain 20 sticks of spaghetti, 1 roll of tape, and 1 marshmallow. Additionally, each team will need a decent amount of surface space to complete the activity.  Make sure each team has a designated working area.

### Goals
  This activity is about teamwork and problem-solving.  The goal is for students to strategize, work together, and overcome failure and obstacles to reach a successful outcome.  This is also a healthy competition within the workshop.  We want the groups striving to win!

### Instructions
  * **Build the Tallest Freestanding Structure** - The winning team is the one that has the tallest structure measured from the table top surface to the top of the marshmallow.  That means the structure cannot be suspended from a higher structure, like a chair or the ceiling nor can it lean against anything like a wall or window.

  * **The Entire Marshmallow must be on top** - The entire marshmallow needs to be on the top of the structure.  Cutting or eating part of the marshmallow disqualifies the team.

  * **Use as Much or as Little of the Kit** - The team can use as many of the spaghetti sticks and as much of the tape as they want. Teams are free to break the spaghetti and cut up the tape.


  * **The Challenge Lasts 15 minutes** - Teams cannot hold on to the structure when the time runs out. Those touching or supporting the structure at the end of the exercise will be disqualified.

  * **Ensure Everyone Understand the Rules** - Don't worry about repeating the rules too many times. Ask if anyone has any questions before starting.

A staff member or Instructor will keep time on a smartphone timer.  Now get building!

Have fun with it!  Play some music during the activity. Make sure volunteers and instructors are walking around the room encouraging teams and helping them abide by the rules. Call out time remaining; give teams a countdown. 10 minutes, 8 minutes, 5 minutes, 3 minutes, 2 minutes, 1 minute, 30 seconds, and a 10-second countdown.

When time expires call out "hands up" to make sure everyone stops working on their structures. Designate 1 volunteer or instructor to measure the standing structures with the measuring tape and identify the winning team.
