We've defined the problem we're trying to solve and who we're solving it for. We've mapped out the overarching areas of the solution and picked the most impactful place to start - tracking assignments. Finally, we listed out the functionality users will need to successfully track assignments using our app.

Time to code? Not just yet. Writing code is time-consuming. Sketching is not. Before we start coding, it's a good idea to sketch out different variations of the screens we’re planning on building. Focus on the flow of the page and all the affordances you want the user to have. This means thinking about every action the user might have to take at any point in time. For example, if they click add a new to-do, but then decide they no longer want to add the item, is there an option for them to cancel and go back?

Like that example, there are many things that you must keep in mind when thinking about how the user is going to interact with the feature, and what you want to place on the screen to help them reach their goal.

Sketches should be low fidelity. This means minimal detail. Use broad strokes and don't focus on how "good" it looks. You're not drawing. You should be able to show your sketch to someone and walk them through what it represents.

Example of a low fidelity sketch:

Here is an example sketch of the page where we’ll view all of our to-dos. This sketch gives very little detail. Squiggly lines represent text, and the boxes look like some kind of spreadsheet. This is how a sketch should look, quick and messy. But with the right context and description, the same sketch makes much more sense.

Sketches are tools for us to put what we see in our head down on paper so we can explain our ideas to others and receive feedback. Sketching multiple variations of one screen forces us to think about the different ways the user may interact with the feature. We must consider different possibilities.
