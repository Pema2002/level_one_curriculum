# Create Your First GitHub Repository
Now that you have your GitHub and Cloud9 accounts set up and connected, it's time to create your first GitHub repository. A repository is usually used to organize a single project.

**1. Go to [GitHub's website](https://www.github.com "github.com"). If you have to log in to your account do so now.**

**2. If your GitHub account is brand new, you will see a page prompting you to "Start a project." Click the button that says "Start a project."**

**3. Name your repository todo_app_front_end in the "Repository name" text box.**
  ![Name your repository todo_app_front_end](/images/create_your_first_github_repository/03.png "Name your repository todo_app_front_end")

**4. Check the box that says "Initialize this repository with a README."**
  ![Initialize this repository with a README](/images/create_your_first_github_repository/04.png "Initialize this repository with a README")

**5. Click "Create repository." You will be taken to a page that looks similar to the one below.**

**6. Leave this page open. You will need to revisit it in the next step when you create your first Cloud9 workspace.**
